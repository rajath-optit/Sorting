# README: Sorting and Cleaning Data in Excel and Text Files

## Overview

This README provides a guide on sorting and cleaning data, both in Excel and text files, including common commands and methods. It includes examples based on sample data to illustrate how to use these commands effectively.

## Excel Data Cleaning and Sorting

### Using "Text to Columns" in Excel

1. **Open Your Excel File:**
   - Ensure your data is in a single column (e.g., Column A).

2. **Select the Column with Data:**
   - Click on the column header where your data is pasted.

3. **Go to the Data Tab:**
   - Navigate to the `Data` tab on the Ribbon.

4. **Click on "Text to Columns":**
   - Click `Text to Columns`.

5. **Choose Delimited:**
   - Select `Delimited` and click `Next`.

6. **Select Comma as Delimiter:**
   - Check the `Comma` checkbox.
   - Click `Finish`.

**Example:**

Original Data (in one column):

```
Account,AWS account should be part of AWS Organizations,Compliance
ACM,ACM certificates should have transparency logging enabled,
```

After using "Text to Columns," the data will be split into:

| A      | B                                                      | C         |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Account| AWS account should be part of AWS Organizations       | Compliance |
| ACM    | ACM certificates should have transparency logging enabled |           |

### Using Excel Formulas

For more control, you can use formulas to split data:

**Formulas to Split Data (Assuming Data in A1):**

- **In B1:**
  ```excel
  =TRIM(MID(SUBSTITUTE($A1,",",REPT(" ",LEN($A1))),(COLUMN(A1)-1)*LEN($A1)+1,LEN($A1)))
  ```

- **In C1:**
  ```excel
  =TRIM(MID(SUBSTITUTE($A1,",",REPT(" ",LEN($A1))),(COLUMN(A1))*LEN($A1)+1,LEN($A1)))
  ```

- **In D1:**
  ```excel
  =TRIM(MID(SUBSTITUTE($A1,",",REPT(" ",LEN($A1))),(COLUMN(A1)+1)*LEN($A1)+1,LEN($A1)))
  ```

## Unix/Linux Command Line Data Cleaning and Sorting

### Removing Empty Lines

To remove lines that are completely empty or contain only commas:

```bash
grep -v '^,,*$' combined_csv.txt > cleaned_csv.txt
```

### Removing Lines with Incomplete Data

To keep lines with at least three columns:

```bash
grep -E '^[^,]*(,[^,]*){2}$' combined_csv.txt > cleaned_csv.txt
```

### Sorting and Removing Duplicates

To sort a file and remove duplicate lines:

```bash
sort -u combined_csv.txt > sorted_unique.csv
```

**Example:**

Original Combined Data:

```
Account,AWS account should be part of AWS Organizations,Compliance
Account,Security contact information should be provided for an AWS account,Compliance
ACM,ACM certificates should have transparency logging enabled,
...
```

After sorting and removing duplicates:

```
Account,AWS account should be part of AWS Organizations,Compliance
ACM,ACM certificates should have transparency logging enabled,
...
```

## Summary

- **Excel:**
  - Use "Text to Columns" for splitting data by commas.
  - Use formulas for custom splitting if needed.
- **Command Line:**
  - Use `grep` to remove empty or incomplete lines.
  - Use `sort -u` to sort and remove duplicates.
